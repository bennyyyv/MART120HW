The biggest difference between Command Line and Graphical User Interface is that GUI is incredibly user friendly and visual and CL is text based and much harder for the average computer user. For me, CL is very scary, the command prompt relies on you knowing what to do and GUI is just
there and it's super easy to look through stuff till you find what you need. The only real advantage that CL really gives you is that it can be much much faster than GUI if you know what you're doing. I've had to use the command prompt to reset things on my PC and you can do a ton with
just a couple of commands and I have no idea how I'd do that without CL. I think that the only way you can use CL is if you have been taught how to which takes a lot of time compared to learning how to navigate a GUI. I typed 'help' into my PC's command prompt and it gave me a list
of commands but I have no idea what most of them mean and the definitions are pretty much useless to me because I have no idea what the computer words mean.
